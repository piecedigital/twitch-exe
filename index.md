There's not much to say about it, except on the struction of the code.

* There's an element with an id of `main-content`. This is where the React view is rendered
* There's an element with an id of `opening-splash`. This is pretty self explanitory
* There's an element with an id of `update-logger`. If there's an update this will open up in full view and will display the various files being updated
* There's an element with an id of `check-update`. It's pretty self explanitory. It checks for updates
* There's an script element with no id, but in it is some JavaScript to handle the popup tutorials from [Tutopop](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tutopop)
