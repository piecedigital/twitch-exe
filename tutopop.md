# Tutopop

[Tutopop](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tutopop) is not a tool unique to Twitch Exe. [Tutopop](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tutopop) is a tool that I created, and it's used for creating popup tutorials/tours on websites. You may already be familiar with this sort of thing.

It's designed to be simple and easy to use, and all it takes to get started is an array with object data. You can check out [Tutopop](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tutopop) here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/tutopop
